# @mantleswap/default-token-list

This NPM module and GitHub repo contains the default token list used in the MantleSwap interface.

## Adding a token

To request that we add a token to the list:
  + [file an issue](https://github.com/mantleswap/default-token-list/issues/new?assignees=&labels=token+request&template=token-request.md&title=Add+%7BTOKEN_SYMBOL%7D%3A+%7BTOKEN_NAME%7D)

## HOW TO WHITELIST YOUR TOKEN
- Tokens are added to tokenlists by MantleSwap team based on market demand and other metrics. 
- Tokenlist is rebalanced every 2 weeks, roughly speaking we add tokens that are top 30 in daily volume, and remove tokens that are below top 40. 

### Disclaimer

Note filing an issue does not guarantee addition to this default token list.
We do not review token addition requests in any particular order, and we do not
guarantee that we will review your request to add the token to the default list.
